# AR_Foundation_Sony
This first release AR Foundation Unity application is a very early example of what AR can achive for advertising.

## Getting Started
This application requires a few prerequisites to run on mobile devices and these are listed below.

### Android Prerequisites

ARCore is designed to work on a wide variety of qualified Android phones running Android 7.0 (Nougat) and later. A full list of all supported devices is available [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices).

ARCore is also required to be installed on the device, this should be done upon intialization of my application, if not search the Play store for 'ARCore'

This application requires the use of your camera for the AR features. When prompted accept the camera request.

### IOS Prerequisites

ARKit requires iOS 11.0 or later and an iOS device with an A9 or later processor. Some ARKit features require later iOS versions or specific devices (such as face tracking which requires the depth cameras).

This application requires the use of your camera for the AR features. When prompted accept the camera request.

## Installing

I have provided a .APK in the release branch that is unsigned and in development so install at your own risk. to install simply place the .APK file somewhere on your phones memory and use a file explorer to find and install (PLEASE NOTE UNKNOWN SOURCES MUST BE TURNED ON TO INSTALL, FOLLOW [THESE](https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/android-basics-enable-unknown-sources-sideload-apps-0161947/) STEPS TO TURN IT ON)

Currently no IOS package is avalible due to not having a development enviroment, if you would like to run this application on IOS please create a executable through the unity project.

## Running the application
The instructions at the beginning last 5 seconds to give the user time to read and udnertand.

Once a surface is scanned and tapped the AR Object in placed, this object can be roatated with the slider.

The 2 buttons along the botom of the slider will play the promo video above the AR object (can be closed with the cross) and a link to the website.

Around the headset are 3 'feature' icons that can be pressed to give you some of the features of the headphones (this could easily be expanded upon over time as well with more information)

## Future Improvments
In the next day or 2 i will be releasing a signed .APK for unity to this project here with all the latest features and bug fixes.
